# About

## City Bureau and Documenters.org

[City Bureau](https://www.citybureau.org/) is a nonprofit civic journalism lab based on the South Side of Chicago. We bring journalists and communities together in a collaborative spirit to produce media that is impactful, equitable and responsive to the public.

TK TITLE is the newest tool from our Documenters program, which trains and pays Chicagoans to monitor local government meetings and distribute their findings to the public, and Documenters.org, which collects all government meeting info into a searchable database.

Government bodies hold thousands of public meetings every day but the vast majority receive no media coverage and produce minimal records. These events and records are spread across dozens of websites, rarely in useful data formats. As a result, these important spaces for democracy too often go unwatched. Documenters.org standardizes and shares locations, dates, times and official government records. To date, our first-of-its-kind transparency tool displays TK# meeting notes and TK# live-tweet threads from more than TK# Documenter assignments—alongside TK# official records like meeting minutes and agendas.

Together, this system offers an unprecedented view of TK# government agencies in Chicago and Detroit at the city and count level. The TK TITLE combines these resources alongside our public meetings access criteria to systematically grade your local government.

## The Open Meetings Act

The Open Meetings Act is a state law that requires meetings of public bodies to be open to the public except in certain, specific situations. It ensures decisions made by public officials are conducted in the open and that the public is able to observe the deliberations behind those decisions.

Under the [Illinois Open Meetings Act](https://www.bettergov.org/news/a-guide-to-the-open-meetings-act-oma-in-illinois/) a “meeting” is any gathering of a majority quorum of the members of a public body held for the purpose of discussing public business. Let’s break that down.

1. “A gathering” – this is broad, and includes meetings held by phone or digital communications like chat or email
2. “Of a majority of a quorum” means the quorum (the number of members that need to be present for the body to pass official motions) divided by two plus one. For example, if the committee has fifteen members and eight are required to pass a motion, five people (eight divided by two plus one) need to be present for the gathering to count as a meeting.
3. “For the purposes of discussing public business” — the attorney general of Illinois has said this is aimed at “discussions that are deliberative in nature” and not “casual remarks.” Ceremonial or social gatherings would not qualify, unless officials use the time to discuss public business.

## TK TITLE criteria

Agencies in the TK TITLE were assessed between January 2018 and September 2019. The TK TITLE uses the Open Meetings Act as a benchmark in the majority of its access and transparency criteria, but certain exceptions have been established to ensure accuracy.

Our criteria for agencies listed in the TK TITLE is based on the following—the agency:

- Holds Open Meetings Act-related meetings
- Has jurisdiction anywhere in Chicago
- Publicizes enough information to be reasonably considered active
